# JavaTutorial_GPT

JavaTutorial_GPT is a collection of simple Java programs, compiled by an OpenAI GPT-4 model during a conversation. It's a tutorial-based introduction to Java, the popular general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented, concurrent programming language.

The tutorial is broken down into several parts, each dedicated to different foundational aspects of Java.
